Shadow Calculator
=================

## Calculate the length of your shadow ##

## Summary ##
  Determining the length of a shadow for different times in the day has many applications, and existing calculators are very hard to use and understand.

## Problem ##
  I read that the optimal time of the day for vitamin D absorption is when your shadow is shorter than your length (when the sun is higher in the sky). There was no easy way to find out what those times were. Shadow length can also be used in gardening, photography, and tanning for example.

## Solution ##
  Shadow Calculator instantly tells you how long your shadow is right now, and how long it is throughout the day, as well as for any time, any day, and any location.


## How to Get Started ##
```
npm install
bower install
node server.js
```
